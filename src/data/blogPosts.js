      <p>Converting PDF to Word is one of the most common document tasks. Whether you need to edit a contract, update a resume, or extract text from a PDF, our free online converter makes it easy.</p>
      <h3>Why Convert PDF to Word?</h3>
      <p>PDFs are great for sharing and printing, but they're not editable. Converting to Word (.docx) lets you modify text, change formatting, add images, and collaborate with others.</p>
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>Simply upload your PDF file, click Convert, and download your editable Word document. Our tool preserves formatting, tables, and images. No signup required.</p>
      <h3>Tips for Best Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use high-quality source PDFs for better conversion accuracy</li>
        <li>Complex layouts may need minor manual adjustments</li>
        <li>Scanned PDFs (images) may require OCR for full editability</li>
      </ul>

    title: 'How to Reduce PDF File Size Online',
    excerpt: 'Compress PDF files to meet size limits for email or uploads. Free tool with target size control.',
    date: '2025-02-10',
    content: `
      <p>Large PDF files can be a problem when you need to email them or upload to systems with size limits. Our free reduce-size tool helps you compress PDFs while keeping the same format.</p>
      <h3>When to Reduce PDF Size</h3>
      <p>Email attachments often have 10–25 MB limits. Job applications, document portals, and cloud storage may also restrict file sizes. Reducing your PDF ensures it fits.</p>
      <h3>How We Compress</h3>
      <p>We use industry-standard compression to reduce image resolution and optimize the PDF structure. You specify a target size in KB, and we compress until we reach it or can't go further.</p>
      <h3>Quality vs. Size</h3>
      <p>Lower target sizes mean more compression and potentially lower image quality. For documents with lots of text, you can often reduce significantly without visible loss.</p>
